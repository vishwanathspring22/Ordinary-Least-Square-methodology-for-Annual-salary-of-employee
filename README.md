# Annual Salary of Employee Prediction using Ordinary Least Square Method

An academic project in Finance and econometric analysis, the coursework is done STATA software. 

This project analyzed factors influencing employee annual salaries using regression techniques. The data covers 1,746 tech sector employees over 4 years. Key independent variables were bonus, total experience, and current experience. The target variable was annual salary. After initial analysis like correlations, ANOVA tests, and visualizations, two OLS regression models were built.

The baseline model explained 76.7% of variance in logarithmic annual salary. Log bonus, total experience, and seniority level proved statistically significant. A 1% increase in log bonus corresponded to a 32.7% rise in log salary. The modified baseline model added interactions and performed slightly better at 77% R-squared. Here, current experience also became significant, with a positive coefficient.

Both models showed some heteroskedasticity but acceptable errors. Multicollinearity existed for categorical variables. Outlier analysis revealed 19 influential points. Model diagnostics confirmed normally distributed residuals. In summary, the analysis strongly demonstrated bonus and experience as key drivers of tech sector salaries. The models provide meaningful insights for hiring and compensation decisions. With additional variables, the models could potentially improve further.
